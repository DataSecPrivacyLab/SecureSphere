# SecureSphere: Advancing Security and Robustness in Query Processing over Outsourced Data

We introduce the SecureSphere framework, which employs the Reed-Solomon Secret Sharing (RS-SS) scheme for secure and robust data outsourcing and query processing. It ensures data confidentiality, even in collusion scenarios among cloud servers, and guarantees query result integrity against arbitrary failures and malicious actions through RS-SS's error detection and correction capabilities. SecureSphere also enhances resilience against inference attacks by expanding and partitioning each attribute domain, assigning ranges to attribute values, and selecting random coefficients from these ranges to create the distribution polynomial in the RS-SS scheme. Additionally, it processes aggregation SQL queries server-side without inter-server communication.



This version is only with .class files By opening the repository with intelliJ, it will be automatically decompiled.
